## Inspiration

Vitalik Buterin sees the account abstraction as a catalyst that can attract a billion users to the Ethereum network.
Smart wallets can transform our interactions with blockchain technology, offering an impressively seamless and 'invisible' wallet experience. Although there are hurdles yet to be surmounted, account abstraction efforts are already playing a pivotal role in accelerating the adoption of Web3 by providing a more integrated and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem.

## What it does

The incorporation of account abstraction in Chicken War Game has the potential to propel Web3 gaming to new heights. With simplified user experiences, games can attract a broader audience, transcending the boundaries of crypto enthusiasts. By removing the knowledge and technical barriers, game developers can scale their applications to reach millions of users worldwide. This expansion can lead to increased engagement, participation, and the establishment of vibrant gaming communities within the Web3 ecosystem. By eliminating the need for users to possess extensive crypto knowledge, the technology opens doors to widespread adoption and user engagement. As the world of gamification continues to evolve, account abstraction plays a crucial role in bridging the gap between blockchain technology and mainstream gaming. Embracing this innovation paves the way for a future of Blockchain.

**What problem we try to solve?**

Crypto wallets are a user's gateway to the world of blockchains — but the user experience for non-custodial wallets is pretty complex, and it poses one of the greatest obstacles to the mass adoption of web3. For a new user to interact with the blockchain, they must: not only create a wallet, but store their private keys and seed phrases securely, purchase native tokens to transfer value, pay gas, and sign every single action that they take on a dApp. With such an intimidating user experience, something must change! So these design limitations present many challenges:

1. Poor security: An EOA’s entire security is linked to one seed phrase. If you lose your private key and seed phrase, you may lose all your assets. And there are no social recovery options. Besides, you can’t set spend limits, 2FAs, etc. for security.

2. Lack of customization: Transactions from EOAs cannot be customized or automated. Owners must manually sign every transaction.

3. Gas payment: EOA owners must own ETH at all times to pay gas for transactions. They can not use any other token.

4. Poor overall UX: All of the above make for a poor user experience which is not suited for most new users.

## Our Vision

When it comes to gaming, players want immersive experiences without any technical interruptions. They want to focus on playing the game, not on complicated wallet configurations or multiple transaction authorizations. This is where Account Abstraction comes in, and here's why:

1. User-Friendly: It simplifies the user experience by hiding complex technical aspects. No more dealing with private keys or gas payments directly.

2. One-Time Authorization with Session Keys: Our session keys allow players to authorize once, and they're all set. No more repetitive transaction approvals.

3. Seamless Integration with Games: Allows a perfect interface with games, enhancing the overall player experience.

## How we built it
We use account abstraction and smart wallet technology on Base combined with Unity engine to build Game Chicken War.

**Technologies I used**

Thirdweb Unity SDK

Thirdweb Account Abstraction & Smart Wallet

Thirdweb Buddler & Paymaster infrastructure for Base mainnet

Thirdweb OpenEditionERC721 Smart Contract

Thirdweb Token Drop Smart Contract


## Challenges we ran into
When using Thirdweb's Unity SDK, Account Abstraction & Smart Wallet, Buddler & Paymaster infrastructure for Base mainnet and tools related to ERC721 and ERC20 smart contracts, creating our current WEBGL game has not encountered any problems.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Seamless Integration with Games: Allows a perfect interface with games, enhancing the overall player experience.

## What we learned
Deep dive into account abstraction and smart wallets on Base.

## What's next for Seamless Blockchain Game with Smart Wallet on Base
1. Apply Thirdweb Pack to open inventory randomly to receive NFT.
2. Sell multiple NFTs to increase player power
3. Create an exchange for NFTs and game items
